## EXPERIENCE
**Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Bengaluru, India**  
Systems Engineer (Software Developer ‚Äì AI/ML)  
Aug 2021 ‚Äì Aug 2023  
- Developed, validated, and tested machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models and algorithms for complex problem statements in computer vision, natural language processing, and knowledge graphs.
- Deployed machine learning and deep learning models on AWS and GCP using containerization with Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
- Implemented multiple microservices in Python (Flask, Django) and C++ (Boost, Qt), integrating cloud-hosted machine learning models and services on AWS and GCP into real-life applications.
- Built ETL pipelines utilizing Apache Airflow to preprocess a diverse range of data types, including sequential (text and audio) and spatial (image) data, and loaded the processed data from cloud into target systems.
- Constructed ontologies and knowledge graphs in Aura DB (Neo4J) to enhance domain representation learning in models for multiple prototype projects.
- Invented multiple deep learning based novel architectures which led to the filing of four patents across multiple geographies and won multiple contracts from leading clients, generating approximately $200k in new recurring revenue for the organization.

## PROJECTS
### CareerCraft AI  
An AI platform for assessing skill gaps based on your uploaded resume and a selected aspiration role and getting course recommendations for those skill gaps.  
Tech Stack: Python, NLTK, Spacy, Langchain, LLM, Neo4J, Graph Neural Network, Relation extraction and Linking, AuraDB, Flask, Docker, AWS (S3, EC2)
- Utilized strategy pattern to build a system with Spacy‚Äôs custom NER and LLM based NER to extract user details and skills from a user‚Äôs resume.
- Created a Python-based system to construct a knowledge graph of roles and skills and constructed a graph neural network to semantically map user's current skills extracted from resumes to the knowledge graph data for identifying skill gaps.
- Designed an importance-based recommendation system algorithm to suggest Udemy courses tailored to individual skill gaps and keyword matching algorithms to suggest job postings relevant to user aspirations and current skills.
- Established a flask server to host the application, containerized it with docker and deployed it on AWS for web hosting.

### Brain Tumor Classifier  
A system for segmentation and multi-label classification of brain tumors from a patient‚Äôs MRI images with deep learning architectures.  
Tech Stack: Python, Flask, OpenCV, Pytorch, TensorFlow, ResNet-50, CNN, Image Segmentation, Transfer Learning, NumPy, Pandas
- Annotated the MRI images of a patient‚Äôs brain tumor collected from different hospitals to mark tumor coordinates on the images.
- Employed various data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, histogram equalization etc. and data augmentation techniques such as mirroring, rotation, flipping etc. to enhance the quality of the data and enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
- Leveraged transfer learning to fine tune the Resnet-50 architecture by redefining the FC-Layer to adapt it for multi-label classification of brain tumors.
- Trained the designed model, achieving an exceptional overall testing accuracy of 99% in segmenting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images.

## AWARDS/ACHIEVEMENTS
- Special Achievement Award (Jul 2023) ‚Äì Tata Consultancy Services: Received this in appreciation for winning the ‚ÄúBest Paper Contest‚Äù for a research paper that presented a novel architecture based on a multimodal approach for performing semantic search.
- Innovation Spark Award (Jun 2022) - Tata Consultancy Services: Awarded for designing, developing and filing patent for multiple solutions based on novel architectures, which won multiple contracts for the organization, generating an immediate recurring revenue of ~$100k.
